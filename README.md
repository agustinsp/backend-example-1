Blog example with Kohana


To install just run the SQL script "blog.sql' and run the app in a webserver with PHP 5.5. It was only tested under the domain http://blog.local/

This is a backend demo of a RESTful API and a PHP code quality. The html, css and js are there only to run the app, not to be considered my best frontend work. To see that, please check: https://github.com/agustinsp/frontend-example-1/.
